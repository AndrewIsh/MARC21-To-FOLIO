# Migration workflow for bibliographic records

## Gather the bibliographic records
Gather the bibliographic records in either MARC21 or MARCXML you want to migrate. 
These records should be bib level only (no holdings or MFHD interleaved)

## Check records in MARC Edit
Just make a sanity check so there are no apparent errors in the records (like multiple leader fields)
